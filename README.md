# Centrality-measures-to-classify-event-and-non-event-synchronyy

## Overview of this project
In this project, we used Twitter as a platform to analyze the behavior of people in social media. During an event, no of tweets about the hashtag related to the event increases hugely and then decreases over a period. Due to this behavior, we label the event as synchrony. During non-event, there is a rise in the number of tweets but not related to an event. It is a generic hashtag where people share their experiences, emotions, feelings etc. So, this can be termed as non-event synchrony. Ex #mondaymotivation is used by the people to motivate themselves on Monday.

## Synchrony
Social synchrony is a social phenomenon in which many people respond or perform an activity together over a short duration of time. The number of individuals performing that activity first increases, remains above a certain threshold for some time, and then decreases to normal. It can be observed in our day to day life in the form of synchronised applause after some performance, choir singing etc.

It is also observed in social media platforms too. Letâ€™s take the example of Twitter. When a hashtag is trending, i.e., a topic becomes popular lots of users tweet and retweet their views over that topic for some duration of time. On analysing the number of tweets and retweets with respect to time, it is found that generally the number of tweets first increases and then decreases in this short time span when that topic is trending. This phenomenon is termed as Online Social synchrony. This can be used to detect the presence of shared concern by the collective activity of users.

## Work

1. "Online Synchrony in twitter" is a python code in which synchrony files(ex #monday motivation) were analysed.
2. "Social network analysis using centrality measures" is a python code in which event and non event synchrony were analyzed .
3.  Detailed analysis of work can be found in the project report

## Dataset

CSV files of synchrony is avaliable on request(leelasuryatejam@gmail.com)
